# linux_profiles
A repo to hold a wide variety of linux notes, profiles and scripts.   
This repo basically acts a remote 'brain'.   
*requires: git*

that can be quickly set up on a system as follows...   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kheremos/linux_profiles.git
```

Review install.sh and run it.   
(This step is important, you should never run arbitrary scripts)
