# linux_profiles
A repo to hold a wide variety of linux notes, profiles and scripts.   
This repo basically acts a remote 'brain'.   
*requires: git*

Can be quickly set up on a system as follows...   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kheremos/linux_profiles.git
./install.sh
```
(Review install.sh, you should never run arbitrary scripts without reviewing them)
